# Kaggle-Titanic-Machine-Learning-From-Disaster
A Jupyter Notebook containing my work for the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition on Kaggle.

Creating a model to solve this problem was a real adventure. I started by creating a bunch of different models, choosing the one with the best accuracy, and generating final predictions with that one. Then, I started experimenting with an artificial neural network (ANN). After some time, I went back to using one of the initial models I made, a random forest, due to its consistent performance and suitability for the small dataset we were provided with. I then implemented an ensemble method with max voting to leverage the strengths of each individual model to make the final prediction better.
